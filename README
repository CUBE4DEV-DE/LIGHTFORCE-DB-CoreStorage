CORESTORAGE
===========
CoreStorage is a module that sits at the bottom of the software
stack and provides a foundation for all of the other modules
to build upon. This means that any other module that needs to
access the file system must do so through CoreStorage. It maintains
this access by providing a set of static classes and methods that 
work with various file types.


XFile
-----
This XFile file contains a collection of
functions for managing files and their contents including reading and writing
different types of data, such as raw Text(QString), UNICODE-Text,
QJsonDocument, QByteArray, QStringList, QMap<QString, QString>,
and QSet<QString>.The functions also allow for compressing
and encrypting data, as well as copying, renaming, moving, and deleting files.
There is also a concurrent function for executing a given function in parallel.
The XFile class includes static methods to perform these various functions.
The file has a template that can be used as a base to create your file and
Description is left as blank, allowing developers to provide context.

XDirectory
----------
The purpose of the class XDirectory is to copy directories and their contents
to another location. They take various parameters such as the source
and destination directories, filtering options, and time ranges for
selected files. The methods use recursion to copy all directories and
files within the source directory. The copied contents will maintain
their original file names and paths.

XFileAlias
----------
The XFileAlias class is defined the CoreStorage-Namespace.
This class has several static methods that allow you to set and update
file aliases, remove file aliases, and clear the aliases entirely.

XFileBlock
----------
The XFileBlock lock on a file identified by its key name.
is used to specify whether the lock is for reading or writing.

XInject
-------
The three classes: XFunctionInject, XStringInject,
and XInject with the purpose of providing functionality for injecting and calling
stored functions in a generic way. The main idea is to provide a template that can
be used for defining functionality for injecting and calling stored functions.
